## Convert text files to netCDF formats

The purpose of this script is to help people who are new to using netCDFs, convert their data into a netCDF format. This script was written to help users upload their data to the Datalakes platform (https://www.datalakes-eawag.ch/?home) , but is generic enough that it can be used for other purposes. 

### What is a netCDF?

A netCDF is a file format that is very effecient for storing multi-dimensional data. The files are also capable of storing metadata so they are self-describing.
